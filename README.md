# HEMU: a TempleOS x86-64 emulator in HolyC

HEMU runs the unmodified TempleOS V5.03 kernel from a saved RAM image. It is written entirely in HolyC and
reaches the outside world through one small host contract, so any HolyC compiler whose runtime implements
that contract can build and run it. [HolyC-wasm](https://github.com/ParkerrDev/HolyC-wasm) compiles it to
WebAssembly, and [TempleOS-Web](https://github.com/ParkerrDev/TempleOS-Web) is a complete host for that
build - its `engine/` implements the contract (with an x86→WASM block JIT), its `tools/hemu/` are the
harnesses, and its `tools/snapshot/` are the recipes that produce the boot snapshots kept here.

This repository is HolyC source and the snapshots it boots. Nothing else.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/cpu.HC` | the CPU: fetch, decode and execute for the integer, x87 and SSE instructions TempleOS uses, plus the devices it touches (PIC, PIT, HPET, CMOS RTC, LAPIC/IOAPIC MMIO, PS/2, ATA, VGA DAC) and the HLE hooks |
| `src/host.HC` | **the host contract**: every function the emulator imports from its host, and the two compiler intrinsics it needs |
| `src/core.HC` | per-core CPU state (`CCpuState g_cpu_st[]` behind the `reg` / `rip` / `rfl` accessors) and the SMP and guest-call scaffolding every entry shares |
| `src/guestcall.HC` | host-injected guest calls, the backend execution primitive (below) |
| `src/snapshot.HC` | the TempleOS entry: resume from the RAM snapshot, HLE of the hot render routines, wall-clock pacing. `HemuInit` once, then `Frame` per display frame |
| `src/snapregs.HC`, `src/snapregs-smp.HC` | generated: the register state captured together with the RAM snapshot (single-core / four-core) |
| `src/boot.HC`, `src/anim.HC` | small demo entries that run a clang-compiled kernel inside the emulator |
| `src/test.HC` | the self-checking instruction battery (`#include "cpu.HC"`; prints pass / fail counts) |
| `live.bin.gz`, `live-smp.bin.gz` | the booted-desktop RAM snapshots the entries resume (384 MiB flat images, gzipped) |

## The host contract

`src/host.HC` is the whole interface. Required: load the snapshot into guest RAM, present a frame, VGA
palette writes, ATA sector reads and writes, mouse and keyboard state, wall-clock pacing, a speaker tone.
Optional: the `__jit_*` / `__ap_run` hooks a host may implement to run hot guest code natively - a host that
returns 0 from `__jit_state` gets a pure interpreter. Two compiler intrinsics complete it: `MyCore()` (this
core's index) and the `__a_<op><bits>` atomics, both documented in the header. Everything else the source
calls is standard HolyC.

The host drives one `Main` call per display frame. `Main` runs `HemuInit` the first time and `Frame` every
time; `Frame` pulls input, runs the instruction budget the host asked for, and presents. A host that runs
`Main` only once can call `HemuInit` and then loop `Frame` itself.

## Building and running

With holyc-wasm, compile `src/snapshot.HC` in strict mode (every `import` prototype in `host.HC` becomes a
WebAssembly import) and export what your host calls back into; then implement the contract on top of
holyc-wasm's `createHost()`. TempleOS-Web does exactly this: `engine/compile.js` and `engine/build.mjs` are
the build, `engine/host.js` the host, `engine/jit.js` the optional JIT. From that checkout, with this one
cloned or symlinked beside it as `hemu`:

```sh
node engine/build.mjs build                    # hemu.wasm + hemu-smp.wasm + hemu-smp.json
node tools/hemu/measure.mjs                    # src/test.HC, the self-checking battery, headless
node tools/hemu/boot-test.mjs                  # src/boot.HC: the demo kernel draws its framebuffer
```

The guest harnesses - boot the desktop, run catalog games, compare the JIT against the interpreter,
exercise the guest-execution API - are in the same `tools/hemu/`, documented in `engine/README.md`.

## Backend guest execution

`src/guestcall.HC` lets the host call one validated guest function with up to eight stack arguments exactly
the way a hardware interrupt enters a handler: at an instruction boundary with IF=1, a frame is pushed on
the current task's stack, the callee runs with IF=0, and when it returns to the sentinel address the
interrupted CPU state is restored bit-exactly. The callee's side effects on guest memory persist; nothing
else does. This is the discipline TempleOS itself uses for IRQ1, so the JobQue family (TaskExe, JobResScan,
PopUp) is safe by construction. Only core 0 injects; a callee that faults or exceeds its budget is reported
as failed and the interrupted state is still restored. TempleOS-Web's `engine/guestexec.js` is the host-side
API over it (`exec`, `include`, `mkdir`, `writeFile`, `launch`).

## Devices and performance

The CPU implements the integer, x87 and SSE instructions used by this TempleOS image. FTST and FNSTSW are
covered in both interpreter and JIT tests, including negative values, signed zeros, NaN and infinities; the
missing FTST previously made native Sign return +1 for every input. The x87 register-destination subtraction
and division encodings preserve Intel operand order in both engines; 432 arithmetic cases cover both signs,
destination registers and wrapped stack tops. Reversing those operands produced negative game collision
coordinates. ATA transfers support both 16-bit and 32-bit I/O, including REP INSD/OUTSD. VGA DAC reads and
writes preserve the 16-color palette and notify the host when colors change. A host must implement both
`__host_disk` and `__host_disk_wr`.

Interpreter, block JIT and verified graphics HLE are separate execution layers. Keep the HLE candidate
verification and rejection path intact: a candidate is armed in verify mode and only activated after its
native output has agreed with the emulated version bit-exactly, so a wrong match falls back instead of
rendering garbage. The SMP build (`SMP_SNAP`) runs one core per host thread over shared memory; keep it
under separate regression testing. Browser networking for TOOM multiplayer is not implemented.

These checks cover observed workloads and regressions, not complete x86 hardware conformance or complete
game playthroughs.

## Snapshots

The RAM images are captured from TempleOS booted under QEMU with the machine paused, together with the
register state that becomes `src/snapregs*.HC`; the two must match, so re-bake the registers after every
capture. The recipes live in TempleOS-Web's `tools/snapshot/`.
